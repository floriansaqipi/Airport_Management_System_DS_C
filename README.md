# Airport Management System Front-End Client

## Overview

This project is a front-end client application for managing various aspects of airport operations, from ticket management to user authorization. The client is developed using React and communicates with a REST API built with Spring Boot, which is part of the same project. This front-end application provides an intuitive and efficient interface for handling airport management tasks.

## Development and Task Management

The development process was managed using Jira, where tasks were assigned, tracked, and completed. The team collaborated to create a stable version, which underwent testing before deployment.

## Features

1. Manage flight tickets.
2. User authorization and authentication.
3. Generate QR codes for tickets.
4. Interactive and dynamic user interface.
5. Real-time updates and notifications.

## Technical Aspect

- **Framework:** React
- **Component Library:** Material-UI
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **QR Code Generation:** QR Code Creator

React was chosen for its powerful libraries and ease of integration with REST APIs, along with its excellent documentation. It allows for efficient state management and component-based architecture, which enhances code reusability and maintainability. React's virtual DOM ensures high performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM.

**Material-UI** was utilized because it provides a comprehensive set of components that are ready to use and customizable, speeding up the development process. It also ensures a consistent look and feel across the application with minimal effort.

**React Router DOM** simplifies the implementation of navigation and route management within the application. It supports nested routes and dynamic route matching, which are essential for managing complex user flows and ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application. This library allows for smooth transitions between views without the need for page reloads, enhancing the user experience.

**QR Code Creator** is employed for generating QR codes for tickets, facilitating easy ticket verification and enhancing the boarding process. This functionality is critical for modernizing the ticketing system and improving efficiency at the airport.

To ensure a smooth development workflow, the project setup includes tools like Webpack and Babel for module bundling and JavaScript transpilation. ESLint and Prettier are used for code quality and formatting, ensuring consistency and readability across the codebase. The use of Git and GitHub for version control allows for efficient collaboration among team members, with pull requests and code reviews helping maintain high code quality.
